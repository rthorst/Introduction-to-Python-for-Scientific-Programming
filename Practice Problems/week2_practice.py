Imagine that, 
3 Participants completed a "future fluency task" where they generated as many
future events as they could in 60 seconds.  The number of events generated was:
    
    participant 1  :   2 events.
    participant 2  :   4 events.
    participant 3  :   3 events.

Store these scores as 3 separate variables.

There is something wrong with the type of each variable below.
Correct the mistake, 
      First, by fixing the way the variable is declared.
      E.g. (bad) score = "4.0" --> (good) score = 4.0
      
      Second, by using casting.
      E.g. (bad) score = "4.0" --> (good) score = float(score)
